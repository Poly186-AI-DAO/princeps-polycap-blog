# Princeps Polycap — Professional History & Recent Projects

# Founder, AI Systems Architect, & Principal Engineer

## I. Executive Bios

### A. Short Bio (For Speakers & Events)

Princeps Polycap is an AI systems architect and the founder of Poly, a labor marketplace powered by autonomous "digital workers"—AI agents that can reason, communicate, and execute complex business tasks. He is also a Senior Partner at Power Moves, a senior development agency that builds custom, high-performance web platforms and scalable internal tools. He specializes in designing and building complete, end-to-end automation systems that diagnose and permanently solve complex operational bottlenecks, moving businesses from high-touch manual processes to fully autonomous workflows.

### B. Professional Summary

I am a founder and principal engineer with a mission to build elegant, scalable, and self-sustaining solutions for complex, real-world problems. My career evolved from a deep foundation in full-stack mobile and web engineering—mastering the craft of building—into a focus on high-level system architecture, AI, and autonomous automation. I don't just build features; I build self-sustaining systems and engines of value that run 24/7.

My work is not just about technical execution; it's about permanently solving a business problem at its core. I architect systems that eliminate bottlenecks, not just manage them. Today, I operate at the intersection of three distinct models, each designed for a different client need and scale:

1. **As a Founder (Poly):** This is my primary mission. I am building a "labor marketplace" of AI digital workers. This is the culmination of my work, productizing automation to make it accessible, scalable, and composable for any business process. This platform model allows me to leverage my work from a service to a product.
2. **As a Senior Partner (Power Moves LLC):** I am a senior partner in a dedicated, senior-only development agency. We are the "special forces" team for complex, custom software builds. We engage with clients who need a full-service team—including project managers, designers, and multiple senior engineers—to build robust web applications and white-label platforms.
3. **As an Architect (Solo):** I engage on a limited, high-touch basis as a hands-on principal. This is for clients who need one person to personally design, build, and deploy a greenfield system from scratch—a "founding-CTO-as-a-service" to take a complex idea from zero to one.

My core vision is to leverage the efficiency and capital from commercial automation to fund the development of systems that can one day solve basic human needs. I believe the profits from automating business processes can be the economic engine for R&D into food, water, and energy security, ultimately contributing to large-scale ecological regeneration.

**Subject: Following up: Princeps Polycap - Professional History & Capabilities**

Hi

$$Name$$

,

Good to connect. You asked for my resume/work history, and I've found the most effective way to share that is my full professional narrative, which outlines my capabilities and recent track record.

To give you a brief summary: I am a founder and AI systems architect. My work is focused on building autonomous "digital workers" (at my platform, Poly) and architecting custom, high-performance web applications (as a Senior Partner at Power Moves LLC). I build the engines that automate business.

My engagement model typically follows one of three paths, depending on the client's needs:

1. **The Principal Architect (Me):** This is a "founding-CTO-as-a-service" engagement. I personally architect and build a bespoke, greenfield system for you from the ground up. This is ideal for complex R&D or building a foundational V1.
2. **The Digital Workforce (Poly):** We deploy AI digital workers from my platform to automate your specific business processes. This is the fastest path to value, handling tasks like 24/7 intelligent lead qualification, customer support triage, data entry, and multi-step API workflows.
3. **The Development Agency (Power Moves):** My team of senior developers builds a full-custom, enterprise-grade web application, internal dashboard, or client-facing platform for you. This is for large-scale projects that require a full project team.

## III. My Philosophy: Three Paths to Your Solution

*(This section is now re-numbered, formerly II)*

There are three ways we can work together. The right path depends entirely on your needs for speed, scale, and custom-building.

### A. Path 1: The Principal Architect (Hiring Me Directly)

You can hire me personally as your principal architect and developer. This is the most bespoke, high-touch (and highest-cost) option. You get a direct line to me, without a project manager or junior developer as a buffer. I will personally handle the entire lifecycle: from discovery and system design to architecture, full-stack development, and deployment.

This path is ideal for complex, greenfield R&D, early-stage ventures that need a "founding CTO" level of engagement, or for clients who need a single, senior technical lead to build a foundational system from the ground up with meticulous care. This is for building the "zero to one" prototype that must be robust enough to become the "one to one-hundred" platform.

- **Who this is for:** Founders testing a new business model, executives needing a high-stakes proof-of-concept, or businesses with a complex, novel problem that can't be solved with off-the-shelf tools.
- **Who this is NOT for:** Clients who need a simple marketing website, have a very limited budget, or just need ongoing maintenance for an existing system.

### B. Path 2: The Digital Workforce (The Poly Platform)

You can leverage my automation platform, Poly, to deploy a "digital workforce." This is the fastest and most scalable solution for automating specific, high-volume, and often repetitive business processes. We can deploy these agents in days, not months, and they can handle ten thousand tasks as easily as ten. We deploy pre-built and custom AI digital workers—autonomous agents that can reason, act, and communicate—to handle tasks like:

- **24/7 Intelligent Receptionists:** Deployed on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, these agents can answer common questions in multiple languages, qualify leads based on your criteria, handle FAQs, and book appointments directly in your team's calendar.
- **Custom API/Webhook Agents:** These agents are the "digital glue" that connects your disparate systems. We build agents to automate report generation, sync data between your Shopify store and your CRM, connect Airtable to your email marketing platform, or execute any multi-step workflow that starts with a trigger.
- **Intelligent Scheduling & Follow-up:** We can build logic for complex human-in-the-loop handoffs, automated follow-up sequences, and intelligent triage that routes inquiries to the right person on your team.
- **White-Label Solutions:** This allows other agencies, MSPs, and consultants to re-sell our automation capabilities under their own brand, empowering them to become automation providers without the R&D overhead.

### C. Path 3: The Development Agency (Power Moves LLC)

You can engage Power Moves, my senior development agency. This path is for clients who need a custom, team-based development of robust web applications, internal tools, or client-facing scalable platforms. This is for mission-critical, large-scale projects.

Our team consists of seasoned project managers, UI/UX designers, and a dedicated squad of senior-only developers. We specialize in building high-quality, maintainable, and secure codebases that power complex business logic. The "senior-only" philosophy is key: it means cleaner code, less management overhead, faster problem-solving, and an end product that is built to last, free of common junior-developer mistakes.

This path is ideal for building SaaS products, customer portals, internal dashboards, or marketplaces.

## IV. My Core Focus: Building the Ecosystem

*(This section is now re-numbered, formerly III)*

### A. Founder & CEO — Poly (A Labor Marketplace)

This is my primary mission. I am building the platform and protocols for a new kind of labor marketplace—an "API for human processes." In this market, AI digital workers are the labor force, and they can be "hired" for specific automated tasks with transparent, usage-based economics, just like hiring a human freelancer or paying for an API call.

- **Vision:** My long-term flywheel is to use the proceeds from this commercial automation platform to fund R&D for basic-needs automation. The efficiency and profitability of automating business processes create a self-funding engine for the complex, capital-intensive work of solving problems in food, water, and energy. The ultimate goal is to contribute to ambitious ecological projects, such as large-scale reforestation, automated water purification systems, and closed-loop, automated food production.
- **My Role:** I am the lead architect and hands-on engineer. I draw the blueprints for the entire system, and I am in the code daily. I personally handle the system design, full-stack development (Python backend with FastAPI, Next.js frontend), Kubernetes infrastructure, CI/CD, and server management. I build it, and I run it.
- **DAO Strategy:** I also lead the decentralized strategy, including DAO governance (Snapshot/Zodiac) and treasury operations (Gnosis Safe). The goal is to explore how to map "workflows as labor" to on-chain incentives, creating a transparent, community-governed ecosystem where developers are rewarded for contributing new digital workers to the marketplace.

### B. Senior Partner — Power Moves Development LLC (The Agency)

Power Moves is the senior development agency that builds our most complex custom applications. It is the human-powered counterpart to Poly's digital workforce—the "special forces" team for human-led projects. This team specializes in difficult, high-stakes application builds and is the engine that developed our in-house, white-label automation platform, "Smart Support." Power Moves is where we build the complex platforms that Poly's agents can then plug into, and it serves as the R&D hub that battle-tests our automation technology with real, high-paying clients before it gets productized.

## V. Track Record Part 1: Principal-Led Projects (End-to-End)

*(This section is now re-numbered, formerly IV)*

For the following projects, I personally handled the entire lifecycle: from initial design and architecture through full-stack web development, infrastructure deployment, and ongoing support.

### GovAssist (2025)

- **Role:** Technical Lead / Principal Developer
- **Scope:** Architected and built a greenfield web app from scratch. This involved designing a persistent agent memory model using MongoDB, allowing agents to recall past interactions and context. I engineered a robust SQS/Mongo de-duplication pipeline to prevent costly, redundant API calls and create a single source of truth for all actions. This also required fine-tuning Browserless viewport settings for reliable interaction with flaky third-party government sites.
- **Impact:** Achieved the core technical breakthrough of successfully rescheduling a U.S. visa appointment from 2026 to 2025. This system provided significantly higher reliability on critical login flows (reducing failures by over 90%), eliminated costly task duplication, and delivered clear, actionable reporting for a high-volume case processing workflow.

### The Pilot Mind (2024)

- **Role:** Web & Automation Lead
- **Scope:** Built the public-facing website and the complete back-end automation infrastructure using **N8n**. This was not just a simple connection; I engineered a deep integration between their LMS, CRM, and scheduling systems. When a user buys a course, the automation instantly adds them to the CRM, enrolls them in the correct LMS module, and triggers a personalized welcome email sequence.
- **Impact:** Provided instant, 24/7 inquiry response via an AI receptionist, created a structured lead capture process, and dramatically reduced the founder's manual administrative load, saving him an estimated 10-15 hours per week of manual data entry and follow-up.

### Clear Matter (2025)

- **Role:** Site & Pre-sales Automation Lead
- **Scope:** Refreshed the main corporate site and architected the entire pre-sales automation pipeline. Deployed WhatsApp/IG DM digital workers trained on technical product specs to handle sophisticated pre-sales Q&A. I built the intake-to-CRM demo request flow that automatically qualified leads.
- **Impact:** Generated a higher volume of more qualified demo requests by filtering out unqualified leads and educating serious prospects 24/7. This measurably shortened the pre-sales cycle and gave the leadership team a clear dashboard on their customer acquisition funnel for the first time.

### Nutreent (2025)

- **Role:** Infra & Web Lead
- **Scope:** Managed a high-stakes infrastructure migration from Domain.com to GoDaddy with zero downtime. This included re-configuring all DNS and implementing critical email authentication standards (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) to solve a company-wide email deliverability and spoofing crisis. I also scaffolded the new website and lead capture flows.
- **Impact:** Immediately unblocked all company communications, restoring brand email integrity and deliverability. This foundational work allowed their sales and marketing teams to resume operations and laid the critical groundwork for their public site launch.

### Urgent Care Colombia (2025)

- **Role:** Web & Automation Lead
- **Scope:** Built the bilingual landing page, embedding a third-party scheduling tool (iframe) for seamless booking. I engineered the end-to-end intake-to-WhatsApp/Calendar notification flow. When a patient books, the system instantly alerts the on-call doctor via WhatsApp with patient details and simultaneously sends a calendar invite to the patient.
- **Impact:** Streamlined the appointment booking process from a messy, multi-step manual process into a single, automated flow. This consolidated all lead handling for clinic operations and significantly reduced patient no-shows.

### Frases (2025)

- **Role:** Principal Developer
- **Scope:** Architected and built the pre-beta MVP for a client's (Jordan Scott) novel, "TikTok-style" language learning app. I developed the core cross-platform application in **Flutter**, building the swipeable video feed UI. I also engineered the entire **Firebase** backend, including Firestore data models and the critical video sequencing logic needed to implement the client's spaced-repetition learning methodology.
- **Impact:** Successfully delivered the core "TikTok-style" video sequencing functionality in weeks. I established the complete production infrastructure, including the Firebase backend and the Apple TestFlight deployment pipeline, enabling the client to move directly into beta testing.

## VI. Track Record Part 2: Agency & Platform Portfolio (Power Moves LLC)

*(This section is now re-numbered, formerly V)*

These are solutions developed by our agency, Power Moves, demonstrating our team's capability in building robust, scalable platforms from the ground up.

- **ClearDesk**
A comprehensive, client-facing platform for virtual assistant services, built and supported by our agency. It's the central nervous system for their entire operation, handling client dashboards, task management, billing, and VA assignments for hundreds of clients.
- **TechQuiz**
An AI-powered quiz and assessment platform developed by the Power Moves team. This platform uses AI to generate dynamic, on-the-fly quizzes from technical documentation, which is then used for technical screening of new hires and ongoing educational assessments.
- **Smart Support (White-Label Platform)**
This is our in-house, "platform-as-a-service" that powers Poly. It's a multi-tenant, secure, and scalable environment designed specifically for other agencies, MSPs, and resellers to build, deploy, and sell their own automation solutions under their own brand, with their own billing.

## VII. My Evolution & Core Technical Skills

*(This section is now re-numbered, formerly VI)*

### A. My Evolution

My career began with a deep foundation in native mobile engineering (Android/Kotlin), where I mastered clean architecture (MVVM/MVP) and reactive programming (RxJava) in demanding, high-performance environments where app crashes or slow performance were not an option. This technical depth was the springboard that evolved into full-stack web development, as I realized that to build truly great products, I needed to control the entire stack, from the database to the UI.

This led to complex backend systems, and ultimately, high-level system architecture. Today, I build and manage entire platforms from scratch. My focus has shifted from just writing code to architecting systems. I now spend much of my time at the whiteboard, designing the interconnected services, data flows, and infrastructure blueprints. I manage the full "you build it, you run it" lifecycle. This DevOps-centric mindset means I am responsible for the system's health, scalability, and security in production, not just handing off code to another team.

### B. Core Skill Stacks

- **Architecture & DevOps:**
This is my primary focus: designing the "blueprint" and the "factory." I manage the full stack, from C4-model system design and architecture to the Kubernetes (K8s) clusters for auto-scaling production workloads, GitHub CI/CD pipelines, and server management required to run it all.
- **Backend & AI:**
This is the "engine" I build. I specialize in Python (FastAPI, Django) to create high-performance backends, AI agentic workflows (using tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex), and sophisticated prompt engineering that forces models to reason, plan, and self-correct. This includes deep integration with any API, webhook, or CRM, and DM automation (WhatsApp, Instagram, FB).
- **Frontend & Web:**
This is the "storefront" and user interface. I build modern, fast, full-stack web applications using Next.js, React, JavaScript, and TypeScript, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for high performance and optimal user experience.
- **Foundational Mobile:**
This is where I started and built my engineering discipline. Mobile development taught me resource constraint, performance optimization, and the critical importance of a pixel-perfect user experience. My expertise in Kotlin, Java, Flutter, and the Android SDK, along with patterns like MVVM, MVP, and RxJava, gives me the perspective to build for any platform.

## VIII. Foundational Career Experience (The Starting Point)

*(This section is now re-Next-gen, formerly VII)*

My current work is built on a strong foundation of enterprise-level software engineering, where I learned to deliver high-quality code under pressure in fast-paced, high-growth environments.

- **Android Developer — Medibio (iLumen)**
Shipped critical features and fixes using Kotlin + MVVM for a complex, data-driven mental wellness app that handled sensitive biometric data from wearables. This role honed my skills in working within a regulated (HIPAA-compliant) environment and ensuring reliable application performance.
- **Android Developer — Vidku (Acquired by Flipgrid/Microsoft)**
Improved core camera/video performance on Android, with a specific focus on challenging tablet hardware and fragmented Android camera APIs. This role was a masterclass in Agile, Git, and MVP/SOLID principles, as we shipped production code multiple times a day in a high-growth startup environment.
